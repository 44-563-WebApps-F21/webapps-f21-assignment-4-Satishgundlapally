<h1>PRODUCED BY SATISHREDDY</h1>
<h3>An Ideal Husband</h3>
 <h4>ACT II.  _Morning-room in Sir Robert Chiltern’s House_.</h4>
 <P>
     
    description: _The Library in Lord Goring’s house_.  _An Adam room_.  _On the right is
    the door leading into the hall_.  _On the left_, _the door of the
    smoking-room_.  _A pair of folding doors at the back open into the
    drawing-room_.  _The fire is lit_.  _Phipps_, _the butler_, _is arranging
    some newspapers on the writing-table_.  _The distinction of Phipps is his
    impassivity_. _He has been termed by enthusiasts the Ideal Butler_.  _The
    Sphinx is not so incommunicable_.  _He is a mask with a manner_.  _Of his
    intellectual or emotional life_, _history knows nothing_.  _He represents
    the dominance of form_.
    
    [_Enter_ LORD GORING _in evening dress with a buttonhole_.  _He is
    wearing a silk hat and Inverness cape_.  _White-gloved_, _he carries a
    Louis Seize cane_.  _His are all the delicate fopperies of Fashion_.
    _One sees that he stands in immediate relation to modern life_, _makes it
    indeed_, _and so masters it_.  _He is the first well-dressed philosopher
    in the history of thought_.]


    <h6 class= "LORDGORING">LORD GORING.</h6> <p class= "speech">Got my second buttonhole for me, Phipps?</p><br/>

   <h6 class="PHIPPS">PHIPPS.</h6> <p class="stagedirection">[_Takes his hat_, _cane_, _and cape_, _and
    presents new buttonhole on salver_.]</p> <p class = "speech">Yes, my lord.</p><br/>
    
   <h6 class= "LORDGORING ">LORD GORING.</h6> <p class="speech">Rather distinguished thing, Phipps.  I am the only person
    of the smallest importance in London at present who wears a buttonhole.</p><br/>
    
    <h6 class="PHIPPS">PHIPPS.</h6>  <p class="speech">Yes, my lord.  I have observed that.</p><br/>
    
    <h6 class="LORDGORING">LORD GORING.</h6> <p class="stagedirection">[_Taking out old buttonhole_.] </p> <p class="speech"> You see, Phipps, Fashion is
    what one wears oneself.  What is unfashionable is what other people wear.</p><br/>
    
    <h6 class="PHIPPS">PHIPPS.</h6> <p class="speech">Yes, my lord.</p><br/>
    
    <h6 class="LORDGORING">LORD GORING.</h6> <p class="speech">Just as vulgarity is simply the conduct of other people.</p><br/>
    
    <h6 class="PHIPPS">PHIPPS.</h6> <p class="speech">Yes, my lord.</p><br/>
    
    <h6 class="LORDGORING">LORD GORING.</h6> <p class="stagedirection">[_Putting in a new buttonhole_.]</p> <p class="speech">And falsehoods the truths
    of other people.</p><br/>

    <h6 class="PHIPPS">PHIPPS. </h6> <p class="speech">Yes, my lord.</p><br/>

    <h6 class="LORDGORING">LORD GORING</h6> <p class="speech">Other people are quite dreadful.  The only possible society
        is oneself.</p><br/>

     <h6 class="PHIPPS">PHIPPS</h6> <p class="speech">Yes, my lord.</p><br/>
     
     <h6 class="LORDGORING">LORD GORING</h6> <P class="speech">To love oneself is the beginning of a lifelong romance,
        Phipps.</P><br/>

    <h6 class="PHIPPS">PHIPPS</h6>  <p class="speech">Yes, my lord</p><br/> 
    
    <h6 class="LORDGORING">LORD GORING</h6> <p class="stagedirection"> [_Looking at himself in the glass_.]</p> <p class="speech"> Don’t think I quite
        like this buttonhole, Phipps.  Makes me look a little too old.  Makes me
        almost in the prime of life, eh, Phipps?</p><br/>
